## Description

This is a project I had to do for college, where we had to create an interface for an application called "Coronavirus System." The purpose of the application was to register Brazilians and it had to include specific information such as vaccination status and blood type, as well as standard information like name, password, address, etc. Initially, only the HTML part was required, but I took the opportunity to add CSS and make it responsive for all commonly used devices.
